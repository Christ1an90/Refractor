# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor: (First Homwwork Assignment)


## Repository

This repository is my first ever repository. Initially I had some confusion about what were appropraite contents of this repository so I ended up including all of the files and images needed to start working on the homework assignment. So this repository includes instructions/requirments for the assignenmt, a folder with all the necessary images, and a few identical copies of a couple folders. The repository than obviously includes both the html document and the accompanying css document that goes with it. Labeled as index.html(taught in zoom metting that index is what it has to be labeled) and refractor.css. 

## Changes made
  So the intitial html link when followed to online had a variety of issues needing correction. Foremost none of the imagery shown in the example reference screenshot of what the site was supposed to look like were even included. Hence this was my first priority. Next there were various issues with sizing out margins and the like to get the 'aside' amd 'ontent sections' aligned properly as to match the example screenshot. Within the code itself I did my best to identify and change non-semantic elements to semantic elements. For instnace rather keeping everything labeled as 'divs', I was more specific using element names like'nav', 'aside', 'header', 'footer', 'article', and so forth.
